# Minecraft-Convolutional-Neural-Network

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A PERSONAL PROJECT. It is full of bugs, badly-formatted code, unnecessary repetitions and poor design choices. It is not a good example of the kind of code I am capable of producing, other than in terms of its complexity.

This is a convolutional neural network test that learns to collect pork from pigs.

I don't know why anyone would want this code but for those that do (and for my future self who will have inevitably forgotten), do the following to make the bot work:

1) There MUST be a "screenshots" folder in the same place as the bot exe file.
2) Minecraft must be run in windowed mode.
3) The Minecraft window name must match the name given in MinecraftBot.cpp in the function GetPixels.

You will also need to edit some of the file paths in the code because at the moment it points to my Desktop (and therefore uses my computer's username).

You should create a room which spawns pigs (I have mine set up to spawn new pigs using command blocks every time the player spawns).

Press the up key on the keyboard to pause the program.
