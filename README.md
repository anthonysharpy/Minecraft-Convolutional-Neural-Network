# Minecraft-Convolutional-Neural-Network

This is a convolutional neural network test that learns to collect pork from pigs.

I don't know why anyone would want this code but for those that do (and for my future self who will have inevitably forgotten), do the following to make the bot work:

1) There MUST be a "screenshots" folder in the same place as the bot exe file.
2) Minecraft must be run in windowed mode.
3) The Minecraft window name must match the name given in MinecraftBot.cpp in the function GetPixels.

You should create a room which spawns pigs (I have mine set up to spawn new pigs using command blocks every time the player spawns).

Press the up key on the keyboard to pause the program.
